Event command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The event command is a special command used to trigger an event. This event can then be acted upon from the rules.
You can send 0..4 event values along with the event.

        endif
      endon


    The event value ``9999`` (4) is intercepted and the rule ``Publish, ... %eventvalue1%+%eventvalue2%=[%eventvalue1%+%eventvalue2%]`` is
    triggered, output payload to MQTT would then be ``Lets compute 123+456=579``
